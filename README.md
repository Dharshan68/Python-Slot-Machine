## Game Play

### Symbols and Payouts

There are 4 symbol with the following payout rate:

- A: 6
- B: 4
- C: 3
- D: 2

If a user has made a bet of â‚¹50 per line, and after spinning, only one line out of bet lines matched with a "D". The prize would be **â‚¹100** because `â‚¹50 * 2 = â‚¹100`. However, if there is no match (loss), the total bet amount of â‚¹150 (â‚¹50 \* 3 selected lines) will be deducted from the balance.
